NAME
       branchdiff - A tool for showing diffs of a particular Python code block
                    across several subversion branches at once.

SYNOPSIS
       branchdiff versioned_file Class.function [-b branch1,branch2,...]
                  [--ann] [--trunk] [-o url1,url2,...]

DESCRIPTION
       This script compares function or class blocks from a particular Python
       file with the equivalent blocks in Python files at the same path in
       other branches of the same repository, or locations on the internet.

           branchdiff branchdiff.py get_block_lines

       will compare the function 'get_block_lines' contained in branchdiff.py
       with against the same function in all branches of the same subversion
       repository.

       ---
       
       Reasons for using this script:
           
           This script allows the comparison of a specific part of code on many
           branches. This is particular useful on projects where there are a
           great number of branches with a large team working on them. Being
           able to compare a relevant part of code with versions that other
           users may have worked on can be leveraged to prevent the same bugs
           being fixed in different ways and help forsee & prevent subsequent
           merging conflicts.
           
       ---

       Assumptions made by this script:
       
           The file you wish to compare is versioned in a subversion repository
           and contained within a directory or a descendent of a directory
           named either 'trunk', 'branches' or 'tags'.
         
           When using the -b or -t options, that the path to the given file is
           the same across all branches and trunk.
           
           The class or function to be compared is defined using a def or class
           statement.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Show the help message for this program.
       
       -b BRANCHES, --branches=BRANCHES
           Specify a comma-separated list of branch names.
       
       -a, --ann
           Show revision & author information inline.
       
       -t, --trunk
           Include diffs from trunk.
       
       -o OTHERS, --others=OTHERS
           Specify a comma-separated list of other URLs which should be diffed
           against the given file.



EXAMPLES
       Comparing a class function across all branches in the repository:
           
           branchdiff myfile.py ClassName.function_name
           
       Comparing a function within a function across select branches:
           
           branchdiff myfile.py function_name.sub_function_name \
                      -b branch1, branch2
       
       Comparing a class with one branch and trunk:
          
           branchdiff myfile.py ClassName -b branch1 -t
       
       Comparing a class across all branches and show revision & author
       information:
       
           branchdiff myfile.py ClassName --ann
       
       Comparing a function with one branch and an arbitrary URL:
           
           branchdiff myfile.py function_name -b branch1 \
                      -o http://github.com/user/project/raw/master/myfile.py
